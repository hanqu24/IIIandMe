# IIIandMe: An Algorithm for Chromosome-scale Haplotype Determination Using Genome-wide Variants of Three Haploid Reproductive Cells

## Introduction

Our recent algorithm, [Hapi](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Jialab-UCR/Jialab-UCR.github.io/blob/master/Hapi_manual.html), infers chromosome-scale haplotypes using genomic data of a small number of single gametes. Its advanced version, **IIIandMe**, is proposed here to achieve comparable phasing accuracy as few as three gametes, pushing the analysis to its limit. he new method is validated with simulation and a citrus gamete dataset. The rapid advancement in genotyping technologies promises a broad application of IIIandMe in disclosing important genetic information.
